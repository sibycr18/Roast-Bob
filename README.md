# Roast_Bob: Twitter Roaster Bot

A scalable Twitter agent service that automatically generates witty roasts in response to mentions using Together AI's LLaMA model. The service uses a microservices architecture with Kafka for message queuing, Redis for caching, and FastAPI for API endpoints.

## üåü Features

- Real-time monitoring of Twitter mentions
- AI-powered roast generation using Together AI's LLaMA model
- Scalable microservices architecture
- Rate limiting and caching with Redis
- Kafka-based message queue for reliable processing
- RESTful APIs for monitoring and control
- Docker support for easy deployment

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The service consists of two main components:
1. **Producer Service**: Monitors Twitter for mentions and publishes them to Kafka
2. **Consumer Service**: Processes mentions from Kafka and generates roasts using Together AI

For detailed architecture information, see [Architecture Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
